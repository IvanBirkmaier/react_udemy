# React udemy course

## Project Description

This repository was created as part of a Udemy React course that I followed and coded along with. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I could not complete the course. However, the project includes a variety of basic and advanced concepts covered during the course.

## Tech Stack

The project was developed using the following main technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Firebase**: A platform by Google providing tools and infrastructure for mobile and web applications.
